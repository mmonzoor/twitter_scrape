# Objective 

The objective of this project is to provide a series of tutorials on filling out forms with Selenium. The first tutorial focuses on using the Twitter Advanced Search form and filling out the forms in *search.py*. 

The second tutorial, *url.py* looks at creating a command line application that takes in a bunch of arguments to create a twitter search link that can then be scraped of more tweets. It is important to note that Twitter does provide a premium search API for such usage but the objective of this repository is to provide more exposure to using Selenium.
